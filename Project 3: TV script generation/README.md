# TV Script Generation
In this project, you'll generate your own Seinfeld TV scripts using RNNs. You'll be using part of the Seinfeld dataset of scripts from 9 seasons. The Neural Network you'll build will generate a new ,"fake" TV script, based on patterns it recognizes in this training data.

# Get the Data
The data is already provided for you in ./data/Seinfeld_Scripts.txt and you're encouraged to open that file and look at the text.

As a first step, we'll load in this data and look at some samples.
Then, you'll be tasked with defining and training an RNN to generate a new script
